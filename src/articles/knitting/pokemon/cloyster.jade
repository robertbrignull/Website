    h2 Cloyster pattern

  div(class='row')
    div(class='col', style='width: 50%')
      p The idea for Cloyster is that it's made of concentric spheres and part spheres. So we have a black sphere, surrounded by most of a grey sphere, surrounded by two clam shell shapes. With spikes on of course.

      div(class='section')
        b Sew up and stuff the black body
      p Sew together the two cast on and bound off ends. On the top or bottom, insert needle through loops and pull together. Through the remaining hole stuff the sphere to your liking. Now pull together the other end in the same way.
      p Don't worry about neatness as all this sewing will be hidden.

        b Row 9:
        | bind off

      div(class='section')
        b Sew on the inner grey shell and spike
      p On the top or bottom, insert needle through loops and pull together. Place the black body inside the grey shell, hiding the stitching on the body. Sew the spike onto the top of the body, between the body and the shell.
      p The body should be slightly smaller than the shell so that you can pinch the shell together to make in crinkled. Sparsely sew the shell to the body in this crinkled way. Make sure to pinch together the top and bottom to make them come away from the body, then do maybe two or three pinches on each side. The idea is of course to make it look like Cloyster's crinkled shell.

Place the corners such that the outer shell is pushed away from the inner shell a bit. You can also sew the back half of the outer shell onto the inner shell if you want.
