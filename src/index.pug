        p I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to my website. I host here some services which I find useful and generally some things I'd like to document.

        p
          | To find out more about me head over to the 
          a(href='/about.html') about page
          | . Otherwise please just have a look around.

            img(class='article-image', src='/img/index/anagrams.png')

          p For fun here is an anagram solver, as sometimes you just need to solve anagrams and it'll be useful to have such a service at my fingertips wherever I go. It works efficiently in logarithmic time in the size of the dictionay used.

          div(class='article-image-wrapper')
            img(class='article-image', src='/img/index/passphrase.png')

          p I'm a strong proponent of passphrases. They are both harder to break and easier to remember than traditional passwords - so there's really no argument against them. To help me in my quest to change all my online passwords to this style I made my own generator and use it myself regularly.

            img(class='article-image', src='/img/index/knitting.jpg')

          p I started knitting in the summer of 2014 and I found it immediately both fun and relaxing. I have always enjoyed the satisfaction of making a physical object myself.

          p So far I've only attempted small projects such as stuffed toys and they've made fantastic presents for birthdays and Christmas. I think people appreciate them because of the amount of care that has gone into them.
