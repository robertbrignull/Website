      h3 Passphrase generator

    p I'm a strong proponent of passphrases. They are both harder to break and easier to remember than traditional passwords, so there's really no argument against them. So to help me in my quest to change all my online passwords to this style, I've made my own generator.

    p This implementation picks four random words from a list of 7512 3-5 letter english words, using suitably secure random number generation. Of course all this is negated by the fact that it's served over unsecure HTTP, but oh well...

    p I started knitting in the summer of 2014. I found it immediately both fun and relaxing, and you get the satisfaction of making a physical object yourself.

    p I've so far only attempted small projects, because of the time needed, so I've made small stuffed toys for myself and my friends. I think they make fantastic presents for birthdays and christmas, I think people appreciate them because of the ammount of time and care that has gone into them.

    p In an effort to learn about the different libraries out there and to decide which I feel is best, I've implemented a number of small examples using multiple libraries. I've tried to compare their conciseness, ease of writitng, performance and prettiness of outcome.

    p The six technologies I'll be testing out are:
