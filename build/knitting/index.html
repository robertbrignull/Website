I found it immediately both fun and relaxing, and you get the satisfaction of making a physical object yourself.</p><p>I've so far only attempted small projects, because of the time needed, so I've made small stuffed toys for myself and my friends. I think they make fantastic presents for birthdays and christmas, I think people appreciate them because of the ammount of time and care that has gone into them.</p><p>For the patterns I've created myself I will try to write them up and put them here, for other things I'll just upload some pictures and try to link to the pattern I used.</p><table class="grid"><tr class="sizing-row"><td style="width: 33%"></td><td style="width: 33%"></td><td style="width: 33%"></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><b>Penguin</b><p>This was the first thing I knitted at all, so I was rather surprised it was such a success. This penguin has become my constant desktop companion. Some people have accused it of being the Linux penguin but I tell you it is not.</p><a href="/img/knitting/animals/penguin.jpg"><img src="/img/knitting/animals/penguin_thumb.jpg"></a><p><a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter04/PATTpasha.html">Pattern</a></p></td><td><b>Dog</b><p>I made this for a work-friend who was mad about dogs, they adored them all and I thought it would be nice to give them this as a parting gift.</p><a href="/img/knitting/animals/dog.jpg"><img src="/img/knitting/animals/dog_thumb.jpg"></a><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/05/knitting-pattern-jack-russell?intcmp=239">Pattern</a></p></td><td><b>Cloyster</b><p>This was the first project where I'd made it up myself rather than using someone else's pattern. I asked my friend what his favourite Pokemon was and he picked Cloyster. Not the easiest one to knit if I do say so.</p><a href="/img/knitting/pokemon/cloyster_1.jpg"><img src="/img/knitting/pokemon/cloyster_1_thumb.jpg"></a><p><a href="/articles/knitting/patterns/cloyster.html">Pattern</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><b>Cat</b><p>At the same time I was also working with someone who was definitely a cat person, there were many dog vs cat arguments so this seemed like a perfect dual gift.</p><a href="/img/knitting/animals/cat.jpg"><img src="/img/knitting/animals/cat_thumb.jpg"></a><p><a href="http://lillielil.livejournal.com/195349.html">Pattern</a></p></td><td><b>Robin</b><p>This was a gift to someone to say thank you. Turns out though there are no good robin patterns free on the web, so I had to adapt a bluetit by changing the colours.</p><p><a href="http://www.lionbrand.com/faq/551.html">Pattern</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><b>Smurfette</b><p>This was a gift to somone for their birthday since they had a large drawing of Smurfette on their wall. I think they were impressed.</p><a href="/img/knitting/misc/smurfette.jpg"><img src="/img/knitting/misc/smurfette_thumb.jpg"></a></td></tr></table></div></div></body></html>
